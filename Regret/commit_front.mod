# ============================================================================
# COMMIT study -- PARETO FRONTIER solve (panel c): the cost-emissions
# tradeoff of a COMMITTED WORLD. H2 is committed (and arrives) at H2YEARVAL;
# the emission target avg_emi = AVGEMIVAL is swept by commit_run.py
# (1.4 ... 2.2). Flexible optimum under the study backdrop (= commit_plan);
# elastic cap, so an unreachable target reports its Pareto FLOOR: achieved
# intensity > target with slack > 0, the curve turning vertical.
# Prints FRONTROW,status,lcop_pv,int_achieved,slack_Mt,ccs_Mt.
